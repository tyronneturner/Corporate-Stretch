                    <p class="text-block">Corporate Stretch specializes in on-site assisted stretch for corporate
                        workplaces, schools, and teams that want healthier, more energized people—without adding
                        complexity for HR or leadership. We bring everything needed for safe, efficient sessions that
                        fit into the rhythm of the workday.</p>
                    <p class="text-block">Corporate Stretch is the corporate division of Mobile Stretch Therapy,
                        delivering our signature StretchBreak sessions to corporate offices, government agencies, and
                        schools across the DC–Maryland–Virginia region. You get the personal touch of a small, expert
                        team with the structure and professionalism that large organizations require.</p>
                    <p class="text-block">Our founder has spent years working with athletes, executives, and staff at
                        high-performing organizations, including private schools, universities, and professional
                        programs in the DMV. That experience shapes how we design programs that work in the real
                        world—not just on paper.</p>
